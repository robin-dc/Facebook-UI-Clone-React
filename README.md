# Facebook UI Clone React : Overview
I have spent quite a while recreating Facebook UI Clone using React, and I am thrilled to present version 2.0.0. The journey to complete this project in a framework has been challenging, but the perseverance has paid off. Though the process may have seemed slow, I am delighted to have accomplished this milestone.
